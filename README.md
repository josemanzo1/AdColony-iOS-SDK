## Getting Started

To get started, here is the link to
[iOS SDK integration documentation](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-iOS-SDK/wiki).

**Note:**

* Tested and verified on iOS 14
* Xcode 12 and up
* Works on iOS 9 and above.
* Not backwards compatible with any AdColony 2.0 integrations due to major API changes.

## Upgrading

#### SDK 2.X

Please note that updating from our 2.x SDK is not a drag and drop
update, but rather includes breaking API and process changes. In order
to take advantage of the 3.x SDK, a complete re-integration is
necessary. Please review our
[documentation](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-iOS-SDK/wiki)
to get a better idea on what changes will be necessary in your app.

For detailed information about the AdColony SDK, see our
[iOS SDK documentation](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-iOS-SDK/wiki).

#### SDK 3.X

Updating from 3.x SDK is still drag and drop update although you'll see deprecation warnings on interstitial API.
3.x interstitial API is still fully functional and will remain fully functional at least until iOS 14 release.
Just drag and drop the framework into your Xcode project. If you are
using Cocoapods, sync with the latest by running `pod update`.

[iOS SDK documentation](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-iOS-SDK/wiki).
